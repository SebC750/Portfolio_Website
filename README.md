# Portfolio Website
This is my official website for showcasing my projects, from personal to work related projects. It includes important information such as: 
1. About section - I introduce myself, my hobbies and what I do as a software developer. I also provide information about my flexibility with regards to what clients will need from me (relocation etc.).
2. Tech stack section - This section showcases all of the technologies I have worked with which includes frontend languages, backend languages, build tools, cloud services and databases.
3. Projects section - A comprehensive collection of my projects. Each one includes a description explaining my motivation, contributions and impacts I have made for my team, clients and myself.
4. Footer - My contact information is included at the end for any inquiries regarding interest in my skills.

I will be updating this website periodically to reflect new information such as completion/improvement of projects, adoption of new tech skills and other future sections.
